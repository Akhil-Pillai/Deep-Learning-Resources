# Deep Learning Resources

<details>
  <summary>Preface?</summary>

  - ## What is it?

    This is a list of resources curated from the Slack channel for Udacity's first phase of AI Track scholarship challenge

  - ## Why use it?

    As the Slack channel will have multiple conversations going on. I thought best to consolidate all the resources into one repository for anyone to access any time without having to go through all the conversations.

  - ## How to contribute?

    All are welcome to open a Pull Request or raise an issue, with the content you would like to share

    - ### What kind of content?
  
      Text tutorials, video resources, youtube playlists, self-paced learning courses, ebooks... I hope you get the point.
  
      All and any form of content can be shared here.

## Self-Paced Tutorials
  ### Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Deep Learning and stuff
  - [CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/) This course is a deep dive into details of the deep learning architectures. Students will learn to implement, train and debug their own neural networks. The final assignment will involve training a multi-million parameter convolutional neural network and applying it on the largest image classification dataset (ImageNet). Much of the background and materials of this course will be drawn from the [ImageNet Challenge](http://image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2014/index). 
      - [Notes](http://cs231n.github.io/) to accompany the Stanford CS class CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition
      - [Python Numpy Tutorial](http://cs231n.github.io/python-numpy-tutorial/)
  - [Coursera: Introduction to Deep Learning & Neural Networks with Keras](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-to-deep-learning-with-keras) This course will introduce you to the field of deep learning
  - [Practical Deep Learning for Coders](https://course.fast.ai/) Step by step introduction to Deep learning stuff!
    - Pre-Requisite: You’ve been coding for at least a year, and also that (if you haven’t used Python before) you’ll be putting in the extra time to learn whatever Python you need as you go. (For learning Python, we have a [list of python learning resources available](https://forums.fast.ai/t/recommended-python-learning-resources/26888).)
  - [Elements of AI](https://course.elementsofai.com/) The Elements of AI is a series of free online courses created by Reaktor and the University of Helsinki. The courses combine theory with practical exercises and can be completed at your own pace.
  - [Coursera: ML with Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-with-python) This course dives into the basics of machine learning 
  - [Youtube: Machine Learning Recipes](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOU2XLYxmsIIuiBfYad6rFYQU_jL2ryal) with Josh Gordon (offered on [Google Developers](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_x5XG1OV2P6uZZ5FSM9Ttw) Youtube Channel)
      
   ### Python
   - [Full Stack Python](https://www.fullstackpython.com/) Build, Deploy and Operate Python Applications
   - [Scipy Lecture Notes](https://scipy-lectures.org/) One document to learn numerics, science, and data with Python
   
   ### Math
   - [Youtube: 3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw/playlists) by Grant Sanderson, is combination of math and entertainment. The goal is for explanations to be driven by animations and for difficult problems to be made simple with changes in perspective.
