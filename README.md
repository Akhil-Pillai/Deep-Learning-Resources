# Deep Learning Resources

<details>
  <summary>Preface?</summary>

  - ## What is it?

    This is a list of resources curated from the Slack channel for Udacity's first phase of AI Track scholarship challenge

  - ## Why use it?

    As the Slack channel will have multiple conversations going on. I thought best to consolidate all the resources into one repository for anyone to access any time without having to go through all the conversations.

  - ## How to contribute?

    All are welcome to open a Pull Request or raise an issue, with the content you would like to share

    - ### What kind of content?
  
      Text tutorials, video resources, youtube playlists, self-paced learning courses, ebooks... I hope you get the point.
  
      All and any form of content can be shared here.
