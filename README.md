# Deep Learning Resources

<details>
  <summary>Preface?</summary>

  - ### What is it?

    This is a list of resources curated from the Slack channel for Udacity's first phase of AI Track scholarship challenge

  - ### Why use it?

    As the Slack channel will have multiple conversations going on. I thought best to consolidate all the resources into one repository for anyone to access any time without having to go through all the conversations.

  - ### How to contribute?

    All are welcome to open a Pull Request or raise an issue, with the content you would like to share

    - #### What kind of content?
  
      Text tutorials, video resources, youtube playlists, self-paced learning courses, ebooks... I hope you get the point.
  
      All and any form of content can be shared here.

## Self-Paced Tutorials
  ### Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Deep Learning and stuff
  - [Harvard CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/) This course is a deep dive into details of the deep learning architectures. Students will learn to implement, train and debug their own neural networks. The final assignment will involve training a multi-million parameter convolutional neural network and applying it on the largest image classification dataset (ImageNet). Much of the background and materials of this course will be drawn from the [ImageNet Challenge](http://image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2014/index).
